# psp_to_pico
this is my attempt at making a sort of communication link (GizmoBridge/HandheldLink) between the sony psp and a raspberry pi pico

# structure
It's going to be a 3 way structure:
- deck 
- psp
- pico

If you're wondering why the deck is here.
I need C++ practice and it's to offer a desktop experience for in case you don't have a psp but want to try anyway.
